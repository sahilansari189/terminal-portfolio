      Hey, I'm Sahil Ansari — Full-stack blockchain developer with expertise in Web3, DeFi, smart contracts, and decentralized applications. 
      Transforming innovative ideas into secure, scalable blockchain solutions.
      <br />
      <br />
      Over time, I built and contributed to projects including DeFi apps, NFT platforms, and even a blockchain-based EHR system using IPFS. 
      These experiences taught me that in Web3, code isn't just functionality—it’s trust and transparency.
      <br />
      <br />
       his space has fueled my passion for building user-centric, decentralized solutions and 
       has made me a firm believer in the future of open, secure, and permissionless technologies.
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm always excited to work on projects that push boundaries and create meaningful impact. Let's build something
      amazing together!
