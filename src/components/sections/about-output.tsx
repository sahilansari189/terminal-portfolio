      Hey, I'm Sahil Ansari — a passionate full-stack developer with expertise in Web3, DeFi, smart contracts, and decentralized applications. 
      Transforming innovative ideas into secure, scalable blockchain solutions.
      Over time, I built and contributed to projects including DeFi apps, NFT platforms, and even a blockchain-based EHR system using IPFS. 
      These experiences taught me that in Web3, code isn't just functionality—it’s trust and transparency. 
      This space has fueled my passion for building user-centric, decentralized solutions and has made me a firm believer in the future of open, secure, and permissionless technologies.

      thanks for visiting!
